# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Deep Learning and Voice Assistant 🎙️

This project is a web-based salary prediction system built using **Deep Learning (TensorFlow)** and **Flask**. It predicts employee salary based on various factors like **Education**, **Job Role**, **Location**, **Industry**, and **Experience**. The application also includes a **voice assistant** that audibly announces the predicted salary.
